Hi üëã, I'm Darshan. I'm a Cells/Neuromathematics Scientist at the [Open Brain Institute](https://openbraininstitute.org/) (OBI) in Lausanne, Switzerland.	Open Brain Platform is an open-source simulation neuroscience platform developed by the EPFL-Blue Brain Project (BBP) and maintained by OBI. OBI's goal is to advance the understanding of the brain by providing access to state-of-the-art data exploration, modelling, and simulation techniques.

I also develop and maintain [open source software](https://github.com/darshanmandge) used for these [single cell models](https://github.com/BlueBrain/singlecell-emodel-suite) such as [BluePyEModel](https://github.com/BlueBrain/BluePyEModel), [BlueCelluLab](https://github.com/BlueBrain/BlueCelluLab), [eFEL](https://github.com/BlueBrain/eFEL), [BluePyEfe](https://github.com/BlueBrain/BluePyEfe) and [BluePyOpt](https://github.com/BlueBrain/BluePyOpt).

I have expertise in solving Neuroscience/Physiology and Biomedical Engineering questions through mathematical models and simulations. Throughout my research career, I have guided several students and have served as a teaching assistant for various international courses.
